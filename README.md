Email Problem
Komodo Insurance is trying to send an email to everyone in the world. They want to share some of their great deals with current, past, and potential customers.

Goals:
1. For their current customers, they want to send an appreciation email, something that says this:
    "Thank you for your work with us. We appreciate your loyalty. Here's a coupon."
2. For past customers, they want to send a note that says something like this:
    "It's been a long time since we've heard from you, we want you back".
3. For potential customers who have never worked with Komodo, they want to send an email that simply states what deals Komodo is currently offering. It would be something like this:
    "We currently have the lowest rates on Helicopter Insurance!"
4. Along with defining the proper class for a customer, your task will be to make an application that allows administrators to do CRUD methods: create, read, update, and delete details about individual customers.
